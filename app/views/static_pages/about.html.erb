  English and language arts instructors have long encouraged students
  to look up unknown words in the dictionary.

	<p>
	But what good does that do?
<p>
	<p>
	Turns out, thumbing through a seventeen pound book does little to improve

	and visual forms, and sharing new acquisitions with friends - all of these 
	things can help build vocabulary without the back pain.
