# 2012 PAN-PEARSON HACKATHON

We are writing a simple web application that translates a common vocabulary activity into a digital format to enhance its effectiveness as a teaching and learning technique. 

The MVP (minimum viable product) allows students to keep a personalized dictionary of words they discover in their reading, TV viewing, and daily lives. Students enter the word, the context in which they discovered it and then, using the Longman dictionary, they search and select definitions for their words.

The application is built modularly, using Ruby on Rails, which will allow for a wealth of features in later releases. 

We plan to add features that allow students to draw a picture to illustrate their words, list synonyms/antonyms, and play flashcard games within their personalized dictionaries. Other iterations could allow teachers to assign the personalized dictionary activity to whole classes and mine student data to for insights about the words students are learning.
